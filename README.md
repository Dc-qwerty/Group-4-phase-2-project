# Business Problem

As the demand for creation of original video content continues to grow, many leading companies are investing heavily in creating their own entertainment . In response to this trend, our company has decided to enter the entertainment space by launching a new movie studio. However, with no prior experience in the film industry, the organization faces a critical challenge, it lacks insight into what types of films are currently successful at the box office.

# Data Understanding 
# Data Source 
The data set was sourced from two main sources
