# Project Overview

With the growing  demand for creation of original video content , many leading companies are increasinngly investing heavily in creating their own entertainment ventures . In response to this trend, our company aims to  launch a new movie studio but lacks industry insights . This project explores current box office trends to provide strategic insights for launching a successful movie studio. By analyzing data from major film industry sources, we identify what types of movies are currently performing best financially and critically.

# Stake holders
* Executive Leadership Team
* Head of the New Studio 
* Production Planning Team
* Investors and Board Members

  ## Business Objectives
  To successfully launch our new movie studio, we need to base decisions on proven industry trends. Our objectives are to:
* Understand the characteristics of successful films, including genre, length, and audience reception.
* Identify the most profitable film genres to prioritize in production.
* Determine budget ranges

  By meeting these objectives, we aim to minimize financial risk and position the studio for long-term success in a competitive industry.

# Data Understanding 
To guide our strategic recommendations, we analyzed data from two trusted sources in the film industryâ€”Box Office Mojo and IMDb. These datasets provide both financial performance and audience sentiment, giving us a well-rounded view of what makes a movie successful.

# Data Source 
The data set was sourced from two main sources 

1.  [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/) it Offers box office performance data for a wide range of films and  included domestic and international grosses.
2.  [IMDb Datasets](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/) it contains meta data and user rating information for a movie .

The data sources were sufficient for our analysis because it combined financial performance metrics with audiences and films meta data .This allows us to identify trends in what types of films are both commercially successful and well-received by viewersâ€”critical insights for a company looking to make informed decisions about the kinds of films their new studio should produce.

# Feature Understanding and Documentation
To support the analysis of film performance and guide our studioâ€™s content strategy, we use features from two datasets

## Box Office Mojo (bom.movie_gross.csv.gz)
Supplementary financial data focusing on domestic and international box office gross.
Essential for analyzing revenue performance across regions.

## IMDb Datasets (movie_basic + movie_ratings)

Metadata and user-generated feedback, including film titles, genres, runtimes, release years, ratings, and number of votes.
Critical for understanding audience preferences and content characteristics.

# Data Preparation 

To ensure that the data set was reliable for analysis  , we did data cleaning and preprocessing of our data.
The data cleaning involved  :

* checking for any missing values .
* checking for duplicate rows and columns . 
*  Converted data types for consistency
*  Merge Box Office Mojo and IMDb datasets using common keys (e.g., titles and years)
*  Calculated total gross revenue (domestic + foreign )

# Analysis Overview 

## Analysis Introduction

This analysis aims to identify what types of films are currently performing best at the box office and which studios are the best to guide our new movie studio's content strategy. We'll examine three key relationships :
1.  Genre Profitability Analysis
2.  Studio Performance Analysis
3. Audience Preferences (Ratings vs. Revenue)

 ## Expected Insights
 By the end of this analysis, we'll provide actionable recommendations on:  
 1. Which genres to prioritize for production  
 2. Which studios are most succesful
 3. Do high ratings lead to higher revenue

We choose these specific variables because they:  
 - Are consistently available across datasets  
 - Represent controllable business decisions (genre, release timing)  
 - Directly measure success (revenue, ratings)  
 - These variables naturally led to the 3 chosen approaches

# 1.  Genre Profitability Analysis
 our main goal was to :
- Understand which movie genres are most profitable (highest average revenue)
- Understand which genres are most appreciated by audiences (highest average rating)
   
# 2.  Studio Performance Analysis
### Goal:
This helps identify which studios consistently produce highly-rated films. Understanding studio performance is crucial for strategic partnerships, distribution planning, and benchmarking success.

# 3. Audience Preferences (Ratings vs. Revenue)
### Goal:
- Understand relationship between IMDb ratings and total revenue
- Identify which rating ranges are most commercially successful


# Key Findings

we created a tableau dashboard to represent our analysis

# summary of our Findings 

 After analyzing the combined financial and audience data, we uncovered several important insights to guide the studio's strategy: 
 
# 1. Genre Performance

Sci-Fi, Adventure, and Animation genres consistently generated the highest average gross revenue.
These genres also performed well in terms of audience ratings, indicating both commercial and critical success.
Drama and Documentary genres received high ratings but showed lower box office performanceâ€”ideal for prestige projects, not profit centers.

# 2. Studio Benchmarking
Certain studios have a strong track record of releasing high-grossing and well-rated films.
These studios could be ideal partners for co-productions, distribution deals, or mentorship in early stages.
Repeated success across multiple years signals strong production and marketing capabilities.

# 3. Audience Preferences vs. Revenue
There is a weak positive correlation (r â‰ˆ 0.20) between IMDb ratings and box office revenue.
Films rated 6â€“7 performed best commerciallyâ€”suggesting mass appeal outweighs critical acclaim in revenue terms.
Highly rated films (8+) often have strong critical reception but more modest revenue, possibly due to niche appeal.
Some blockbuster franchises performed well despite mid-range ratings, driven by brand loyalty and strong marketing.

These findings highlight the need for a balanced portfolio strategyâ€”combining high-revenue genre films with critically respected projects to grow both profit and reputation.

# Key Variables used in analysis
 The key variables used included :
 * Title - the name of the film
 * Release_date	- Original theatrical release date
 * Genre -primary content type , narrative style of each film. 
 * Average rating - 	IMDb average user rating
 * domestic_gross	Domestic box office gross 
 * foreign_gross	Foreign box office gross 
 * Total gross - 


# Relevance of the Analysis

The findings help inform what kinds of films to produce, how to allocate budgets, and when to release them maximizing both financial return and brand value.




# Strategic Recommendations
Based on our analysis of box office trends and audience preferences, we propose the following strategic actions to guide the launch and growth of the new movie studio:

ðŸŽ¯ 1. Focus on High-Performing Genres
Prioritize Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi, and Animation films, which consistently deliver strong box office returns.

Develop franchise-ready content in these genres to build long-term audience engagement and brand equity.

ðŸ’° 2. Adopt a Balanced Production Strategy
Allocate larger budgets to blockbuster genres with proven commercial success.

Invest in mid-range budget films in genres like Drama and Documentary to build critical acclaim and diversify the studio's portfolio.

ðŸ“… 3. Optimize Release Timing
Schedule major releases around holiday seasons (e.g., summer, December), when audience turnout and revenue potential are highest.

Avoid crowded release periods dominated by major competitors unless backed by strong marketing.

 4. Pursue Strategic Partnerships
Collaborate with top-performing studios for co-productions, knowledge transfer, and wider distribution networks.
Leverage industry partnerships to reduce risk and increase exposure for debut releases.

 5. Build a Data-Driven Culture
Continue monitoring audience trends, ratings, and financial metrics post-release to refine future strategies.
Incorporate feedback loops and predictive analytics into decision-making processes.

By following these recommendations, the new studio can position itself for both short-term box office success and long-term brand growthâ€”creating content that resonates with audiences and generates sustainable profits.

# Conclusion

Our analysis offers a data-driven roadmap for launching a successful and competitive movie studio. By combining financial performance metrics from Box Office Mojo with audience insights from IMDb, we identified what makes certain films commercially successful and critically appreciated.
The analysis reveals:
1. Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi, and Animation genres offer the highest potential for profitability.
Films with average IMDb ratings between 6 and 7 tend to perform best at the box office, indicating a preference for broad audience appeal.
2. Strategic partnerships with established studios can improve production quality and boost distribution reach.
3. Mid-range budget planning and seasonal release timing are key to maximizing return on investment.

While the analysis yielded valuable insights, several limitations were encountered some of them are : we had Incomplete Data, Some films were missing key fields  which reduced the sample size after cleaning. we also encountered Data Merging Issues , Matching films across datasets required aligning titles and release years, which introduced potential for mismatches or dropped records. Genre Ambiguity , many films were tagged with multiple genres, making it difficult to assign clear labels. We addressed this by "exploding" genres, but this may dilute genre-specific insights. International Market Complexity, Foreign gross data lacked regional breakdowns, limiting our ability to analyze performance in specific countries or continents.Rating Bias,IMDb ratings reflect viewer sentiment but may skew toward more active or niche audiences, potentially biasing our interpretation of popularity.

Despite these challenges, our findings provide a solid strategic foundation for decision-making. Future work could include integrating streaming platform performance, social media sentiment, or production cost data for a more holistic view.
